# Duke Tech Incubator Database
## What it does 
This website allows you to view all projects active in the Duke Tech Incubator and filter them by various commands (in v0.1, just by the fake professor name). You can also submit your own project in the form at the bottom, after which it goes into a black hole, since there is no database behind it :)
