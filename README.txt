README.txt
This game is designed as described in the How To: an interactive pong game in which the user has to clear a random set of blocks without losing the ball to win. The number of blocks is randomly determined, as is the longevity of them on the board.
I relied on https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript/Create_the_Canvas_and_draw_on_it and the provided pong tutorial, with some modification for cheat keys, design, and brick pervasiveness.
